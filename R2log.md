# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### Day 1: Tuesday September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**

I have been working through the Treehouse Node.js course, buidling my first command-line application.

**Thoughts** 

It's great to be back to regular coding after a fun, but not very productive (at least code-wise) summer.  I have been waiting **months** to learn Node, but it's been important for me to get my JS fundamentals down first.  I have been working through the Treehouse "Fullstack Javascript" courses. I still have some work to do on the Object Oriented Javascript section, but I've decided to do that in tandem with my Node.js work, just to keep things interesting.

Treehouse has online "workspaces" that allow you to code in the browser however for this project I'm finding it much more useful and instructive to do the work in VS code, and use my mac's Terminal.
